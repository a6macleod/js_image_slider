# js_image_slider

A basic image slider created using vanilla JavaScript and webpack.

## How it works

The images will advance to the next image after 5 seconds. When you mouse over the image the timer will stop and when you move your mouse off of the image the timer will resume.

### Manual image change

To manually advance the image click the arrow button on the right.

To mannually go back an image click the arrow button on the left.

To jump directly to the image associated with the dot below the gallery you can click directly on the dot.
